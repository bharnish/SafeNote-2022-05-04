        <b>AES128</b> - The note is stored in the database using AES - 128 bit encryption. AES uses a key and an <abbr
            title="Initialization Vector">IV</abbr>.
        Neither the key nor IV are stored in the DB. They only exist in the generated URL.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>SHA256</b> - The note's database id is a SHA, 256 bit, non-reversable, hash of the IV and key.
    </p>

    <p>
        When retrieving a note, the IV and key are hashed with SHA256 to generate the db key. The note is read from the
        DB, and then deleted.
        The IV, combined with the key, are used to decrypt the note.

        <b>AES128</b> - The contents are stored in the database using AES.
        Neither the key nor IV are stored in the DB.
        The key and IV are generated using <b>PBKDF2</b> from the password in the generated URL.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>PBKDF2</b> - A random 8 character (48 bit) password is created, and a random salt is used to derive the key
        and IV for AES. The salt is stored in the db, and the key only exists in the generated URL.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>SHA256</b> - The note's database id is a SHA, 256 bit, non-reversable hash of the password.
    </p>
    <p>
        When retrieving a note, the password is hashed with SHA1 to generate the DB key. The note is read from the DB,
        and then deleted.
        The password is combined with the stored salt, to derive the AES key and IV, which are used to decrypt the note.
